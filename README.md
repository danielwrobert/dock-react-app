# Docker + Create React App

A React development environment using Docker and Create React App.

## Installation

Clone this repo to your project directory - `git clone git@github.com:danielwrobert/dock-react-app.git [LOCAL PROJECT DIRECTORY]`

## Setup and Usage

1. Run the setup script by typing `sh bin/setup.sh` in your terminal. This will check if the image has already been built on your machine. If not, it will build the image and then create the container.
1. Run your application with the Docker image for the first time by running `docker-compose up -d`.
1. Edit the application files from the shared `app` directory on your local machine.
1. When you're finished working, you can stop your Docker container by running `docker-compose stop`.
1. To start your Docker container back up, run `docker-compose stop`.
1. If you're _completely_ finished with you application and wish to remove it from your machine, you can do so by running `docker-compose down --volumes` (you can view the full `docker-compose` CLI reference [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/).

**Things to note**

The in the Docker file, we're starting from the `node:latest` image. This gives you the latest version of Node. If you're working on a project (especially if you pull other people in), you may want to explicitly set a version to ensure that everyone is working from the exact same environment. You can see the available versions [here](https://store.docker.com/images/node).

_TODO: Planning to publish image to Docker Hub and move initial setup commands to a `setup.sh` script._
